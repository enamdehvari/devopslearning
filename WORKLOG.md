#  6th october 2025 I started making my local infra portfoli on linux here.  

#  7th october 2025 I installed git and locallized it and pushed it to my online rep

#  12th November 2025 Practiced Bash functions and here-documents by building a system_info.sh script.
#    Generated an HTML system report using uptime, df, and du commands.
#    Strengthened understanding of command substitution and modular function design.

# 15th November 2025 Built an interactive Bash menu using while-loop control and nested if logic.
#     Implemented here-document UI rendering, regex input validation, and user privilege detection (id -u).

# 18th November 2025 Implemented an alternative interactive menu using case branching with until loop control.
#     Applied guard clauses, regex validation, and delayed feedback using sleep.
#     Technical breakthrough: combined case dispatching with runtime privilege detection for cleaner control flow.



# 21th November 2025 Explored case branching (Ch.31) and pattern matching with POSIX character classes.
#    Understood how read + $REPLY integrate with conditional flow in interactive scripts.
#    Technical breakthrough: grasped ;;& to trigger multiple matching branches instead of stopping at first match.


# 24th November 2025 Practiced wildcard handling in Bash loops to prevent globbing failures.
#     Implemented pathname guard using [[ -e ]] to avoid unintended literal pattern expansion..


# 17th February 2026 Completed recursive Bash directory analyzer (dir_summary.sh).
#     Implemented argument validation, guard clauses, recursive traversal, and symlink-safe logic.
#     Strengthened understanding of recursion, file tests (-d, -f, -L), and safe CLI design.
#     Structured script properly inside repo and committed with clean Git workflow.
